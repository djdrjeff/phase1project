# phase1project

The document entails data on how wi handled the low risk aircraft analysis project for the compnay entry into the field of aviation 

# Overview

Aviation offers advantages in different ways and while at it, also the cons are to be considered whn one is getting into the industry. With this project I aim to achieve a comprehensive way to mitigate the risks that come by with owning aircrafts both commercial and privately used

# Business Understanding


The main goal of the company at hand  diving into the aviation industry is to diversify their portfolio. 
With this project I will help the compnay to consider and achieve a number of things including;

-	Identifyingaeroplanes with the least historical rating of risks
-	Understand trens, patterns and causes of aircrafts based accidents
-	Provide a comprehensive purchase and operation procedures datasheet of aircrafts

# Data Understanding and Analysis

The data at hand has records of aviation accidents sourced from national aviation safety database whuch includes the make, model, types of incidents and accidents, locations and outcomes

# EDA
# Cleaning

Data cleaning involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis, focusing on essential datasuch as accident severity and frequency.

# Analysis
I conducted a cleaning and filtering process to analyze aircraft models with statistically significant lower accident rates. My analysis included:
 
# Visualizations
I created bar charts to represent the findings clearly, showing the safest aircraft models and trends in accident data over time.

# Conclusion

My analysis identified several aircraft models that consistently show lower accident rates, making them ideal for the companies aviation fleet. These findings will play a crucial role in guiding the aircraft purchase and operational decisions.

# Next Steps
- Further detailed analysis on the causes of accidents for the identified models.
- Integration of real-time data tracking to continuously update our safety assessments.
- Expansion of the dataset to include newer models and international data for a global perspective.
